;;; instructions.lisp
;;; ------------------
;;;
;;; This file defines the available instruction set used by programs in BES.
;;; It provides safe mathematical operations for execution within
;;; evolved programs, guarding against numerical issues such as
;;; overflow, division by zero, and domain errors.
